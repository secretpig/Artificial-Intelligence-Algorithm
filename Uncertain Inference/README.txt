1. Content of files
Programming language is Python, for python IDLE 3.6
There are 8 files
1) Exact_xml.py(to read xml file)
2) Appro_xml.py(to read xml file)
3) Exact_bif.py(to read bif file)
4) Appro_bif.py(to read bif file)
5) aima-alarm.xml (Burglary problem)
6) aima-wet-grass.xml (Sprinkler problem)
7) child.bif
8) alarm.bif
libs which are used in programming
1) sys
2) random
3) numpy
4) xml.dom.minidom
5) re
6) time
2. How to run files
Step1: go to the directory where you have all your source files
Step2: enter "python Exact_xml.py" or "python Appro_xml.py" to test xml file,
"python Exact_bif.py", "python Appro_bif.py " to test bif file
3. How to upload files and query

Exact_xml.py
Step1: the system will ask you to input the name of the file with Bayes net, such as “aimaalarm”
Step2: the system will upload the content of xml and create Bayes net and show the
content of Bayes net, you can see all the variables and CPTs of them3 / 14
Step3: the system will ask you to input the name of variable that you want to ask, such
as “B”
Step4: then the system will require you to input evidence variables you should input
variables with space between them
Step5: then the system will require you to input value of evidence variables, T stands for
True, F stands for False
Step6: finally, the system will show distribution of variables that you asked

Appro_xml.py
Step1: the system will ask you to input the name of the file with Bayes net, such as “aimaalarm”
Step2: the system will upload the content of xml and create Bayes net and show the
content of Bayes net, you can see all the variables and CPTs of them
Step3: the system will ask you to input the name of variable that you want to ask, such
as “B”
Step4: then the system will require you to input evidence variables you should input
variables with space between them
Step5: then the system will require you to input value of evidence variables, T stands for
True, F stands for False
Step6: input sample size
